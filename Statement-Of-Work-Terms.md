##Terms of Statement of Work
This Statement of Work may be either a general or specific overview and scope of certain communication forums and interactive web activities with a client. It typically includes information about open source platforms, applications, products, and services that have market potential, warrant inclusion as active projects and business cases in online portfolios, encourage people with expertise to develop them further, and assess future implications for a client going forward, or any other work that the service provider will perform for a client. It is also intended to describe and govern certain strategy and management consulting services which may be provided on an ongoing or requested basis for a client.
