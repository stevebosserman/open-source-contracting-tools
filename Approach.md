##Approach
As noted in the previous section, for organizations to successfully navigate into a collaborative environment characterized by open source products, services, processes, and infrastructure requires an adaptive framework that keeps activities in perspective yet draws attention to details.

This framework also serves to guide the relationship between a client seeking to enter, expand, and sustain presence in the open source arena and the consultant who serves as a coach during the process.

Part of that framework is the **Responsibility Transfer** table below outlines a series of topics - _communication - culture - content - technical_ - that when given due consideration in conversations between consultants and their prospective or contracted clients will lead organizations to more freely present information and knowledge as an invitation to open source community members to collaborate.

| Responsibility Transfer 	|        	|          	|        	|          	|        	|          	|        	|          	|
|-------------------------|--------|----------|--------|----------|--------|----------|--------|----------|
|                         	| Client 	| Consultant 	| Client 	| Consultant 	| Client 	| Consultant 	| Client 	| Consultant 	|
| Technical             |        	|          	|        	|          	|        	|          	|        	|          	|
| Content           	|        	|          	|        	|          	|        	|          	|        	|          	|
| Culture               |        	|          	|        	|          	|        	|          	|        	|          	|
| Communication         |        	|          	|        	|          	|        	|          	|        	|          	|
|       Timeframe  		|       	|	    	|       	|	   	    |       	|	   	 	|       	|	        |

Starting at the bottom of the y-axis, the transition begins and continues unabated with **communication**.  At the outset, the parties engage in casual “conversations” through email, phone calls, or face-to-face meetings.  Eventually, they adopt more moderated sessions for information leveling, addressing particular issues and opportunities, delivering training, etc.  Organization members involved in this range of conversation identify potential and real stress points in the current **culture**; anticipate how the culture could adapt in the face of new possibilities; and assume responsibility for compelling **content** that attracts others in the organization and within its broader social ecosystem to experiment with approaches in both **technical** and relationship aspects that facilitate this cultural shift. As the columns across the top suggest, the consultant and client share responsibility for progress in each stage, but both parties expect the client to take more responsibility for each from one time period to the next until the client is self-sufficient. 

In addition to responsibility transfer, adaptive frameworks also guide participants toward effective collaboration by grouping their activities into logical categories and arranging them as milestones along a **Project Timeline** as illustrated in the table below. 

| Project Timeline 	|   	|   	|   	|   	|   	|   	|   	|   	|
|------------------	|---	|---	|---	|---	|---	|---	|---	|---	|
| Evaluation        	|   	|   	|   	|   	|   	|   	|   	|   	|
| Execution       	|   	|   	|   	|   	|   	|   	|   	|   	|
| Planning        	|   	|   	|   	|   	|   	|   	|   	|   	|
| Assessment         	|   	|   	|   	|   	|   	|   	|   	|   	|
| Iteration       	|   X	|   X	|   X	|   X	|   X	|   X	|   X	|   X	|
| Milestone        	| 1 	| 1 	| 2 	| 2 	| 3 	| 3 	| 4 	| 4 	|

These categories as listed in the y-axis - **Iteration** - **Assessment** - **Planning** - **Execution** - **Evaluation** - organize topics related to the aforementioned culture, content, and technical know-how and present them for consideration by participants in their communications.  As a result, participants talk about what's important, try out ways to move forward, and transfer what works.  And they repeat these three steps over and over again as an iterative process from category to category along the timeline.

_Iteration_ - The principle of ongoing learning and adaptation applies throughout the life of the project at hand and oftentimes continues well beyond the boundaries of its initial charter.  Establish this attitude from the onset of the initial, exploratory conversations with potential clients.  Give them the immediate experience of open collaboration to understand current conditions, sense future opportunities, and experiment with alternatives, and build on successes: Talk - Try - Transfer.

_Assessment_ - Interview client personnel and determine readiness for open source community engagement.
>Key Questions:_
>>- Why does the client want to participate an open source environment?
>- How well does the client understand organizational culture and operational / business models that commercialize delivery of know-how rather than knowledge?
>- How proficient is the client in communication systems, platforms, applications, and media that digitize knowledge and transfer know-how?
>- What is the client’s reputation for transparency, trustworthiness, and commitment?
>- Who can speak to the client’s commitment to open source?
>- What are the client’s expectations for outcomes as a result of having engaged the open source community?

_Planning_  - Develop work plan for the rollout of communication strategies and forums.  Involve client representatives in the planning process in order to determine what type of information would be useful, manage expectations in terms of output, cost, ease of use, etc., coordinate implementation and select performance metrics that expedite successful outcomes.
>Key Questions:
>>- How effective is the client’s current communication strategy in an open source arena?
>- How scalable is the client’s communication system in response to engagement with the open source community?
>- How adaptive is the client’s communication culture and content in support of collaboration between innovators and peers on open source initiatives?
>- What changes in the client’s communication strategy and modifications in its communication systems will be required to prompt effectiveness, scalability, and adaptiveness when participating in an open source world?
>- What are the implications of communication system changes on budget, resources, and revenue generation?

Execution_ - Establish, moderate, and contribute to communication forums (backchannel) and social media for client representatives and contracted team members to use during all phases of the initiative, demonstrate their effectiveness, and invite others as the initiative matures. 
>Key Questions:
>>- How can the client utilize open source platforms, like [Rocket.Chat](https://rocket.chat/) and [Loomio](https://www.loomio.org/), that are readily available, easy to use, and enjoy developer communities that continue to make upgrades and improvements? 
>- How can the client’s communication content inspire exploration and learning about collaborative economies and attendant organization structures and work relationships?
>- How can the client’s online presence invite and easily accommodate innovators and peers and their open source projects and plans?
>- How can the rollout of the client’s communication forums and online presence accommodate feeds from other sites like [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/), [Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/), [Hackaday](http://hackaday.com/), [Inteligencia Colectivas](http://www.inteligenciascolectivas.org/), and [UpWork](https://www.upwork.com/) to create content that increases the attractiveness and value of the site?
>- How can information from these forums and platforms feed into trend analyses and market research for the client that bolsters the value of its know-how drives value exchanges for mutual benefit?

_Evaluation_ - Track progress according to measures related to key questions in each category.  At a minimum the evaluation method should account for the expected impact that executing the plan had intended as specified by the client during the assessment.  Because this correlation between outcomes and expectations is a critical gauge of learning and adaptation, two considerations: first, each milestone should have progress indicators that denote the free-flow of knowledge and transfer of know-how as they relate to that particular activity category; and second, the contract terms for cost, time, results, and value exchange should be organized by milestone.  The combination of these two applied during evaluation allow both the client and the consultant to have their contractual relationship support their value exchange and vice versa.  In other words, a pause comes at the conclusion of each milestone whereby both parties can account for progress and value derived by their collaboration and decide based on the evaluation whether to pursue the next milestone, end the project where it stands, or renegotiate the terms for continuation - conversations definitely worth having!
