##Approach
As noted in the previous section, for organizations to successfully navigate into a collaborative environment characterized by open source products, services, processes, and infrastructure requires an adaptive framework that keeps activities in perspective yet draws attention to details.

This framework also serves to guide the relationship between a client seeking to enter, expand, and sustain presence in the open source arena and the consultant who serves as a coach during the process.

Part of that framework is the **Responsibility Transfer** table below outlines a series of topics - _communication - culture - content - technical_ - that when given due consideration in conversations between consultants and their prospective or contracted clients will lead organizations to more freely present information and knowledge as an invitation to open source community members to collaborate.

| Responsibility Transfer 	|        	|          	|        	|          	|        	|          	|        	|          	|
|-------------------------|--------|----------|--------|----------|--------|----------|--------|----------|
|                         	| Client 	| Consultant 	| Client 	| Consultant 	| Client 	| Consultant 	| Client 	| Consultant 	|
| Technical             |        	|          	|        	|          	|        	|          	|        	|          	|
| Content           	|        	|          	|        	|          	|        	|          	|        	|          	|
| Culture               |        	|          	|        	|          	|        	|          	|        	|          	|
| Communication         |        	|          	|        	|          	|        	|          	|        	|          	|
|       Timeframe  		|       	|	    	|       	|	   	    |       	|	   	 	|       	|	        |

Starting at the bottom of the y-axis, the transition begins and continues unabated with **communication**.  At the outset, the parties engage in casual “conversations” through email, phone calls, or face-to-face meetings.  Eventually, they adopt more moderated sessions for information leveling, addressing particular issues and opportunities, delivering training, etc.  Organization members involved in this range of conversation identify potential and real stress points in the current **culture**; anticipate how the culture could adapt in the face of new possibilities; and assume responsibility for compelling **content** that attracts others in the organization and within its broader social ecosystem to experiment with approaches in both **technical** and relationship aspects that facilitate this cultural shift. As the columns across the top suggest, the consultant and client share responsibility for progress in each stage, but both parties expect the client to take more responsibility for each from one time period to the next until the client is self-sufficient.
